## 本月阅读

《笑场》：2024-03-05 21:26:14 看完。2 星。原本以为是李诞关于工作内容的书籍，没想到是小说。刚开始看没继续看下去，今天中午从 Kindle 偶然翻出来，看到澈丹的故事，被感动了到了，然后接着读完了。内容还挺有意思的。在听《文化有限》一期播客的时候介绍四本书，其中有一句讲到，李诞的这几本书进步之巨大。好奇后面几本书的内容是什么样的。

## alias do

今天尝试 nuxt 的时候，在 zshrc 配置文件中设置了一个别名，用来快速启动应用。

```bash
alias do = "nr run dev"
```

在激活 zshrc 的时候，遇到两个错误

刚开始以为是环境问题，重新安装了几次都无法解决。于是尝试查看这两处的源码，也没有发现什么问题。

然后开始 google，发现一个 [issue](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/987)

原来是把保留字设置为别名导致 bash 命令行函数执行的时候误解了。

case，esac：用于模式匹配和条件选择。

while，until：用于 while 和 until 循环。

{，}：代码块的开始和结束。
function：函数定义的开始。
!：逻辑 NOT 操作符。
[[，]]：用于高级条件表达式。
time：用于计时命令执行时间。

## Cancel follow someone, get more info

2024-03-19 08:56:32t
My RSS and Twitter are following too many people. Following too many people can lead to an overload of information. I don't have enough time to deal with all these information. If I'm looking to obtain high-quality information from these individuals. Maybe I should consider keeping only these who share valuable information.

## 2024 FuZhou Staryberry Music Fesitival

Today I received the volunteer application message for the FuZhou Staryberry Music Festival, Which has left me very excited and unable to sleep. However, I'm more focused on the work project.

## 左耳听风-传奇程序员练级攻略

2024-03-22 01:51:13
Star: 4.6/5
It is an excellent book. It serves as an excellent guide for junior programmers. However, it lacks some content on varied growth paths for programmers compared to Geek Time. The most crucial aspect is personal growth. If Chen Hao were still with us, I can hardly imagine the heights his company would have reached. I aspire to join a company like his, MegaEase.

## Japan Visa
